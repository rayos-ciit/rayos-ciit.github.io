        <h2>My Music</h2>
        <p>This is my work related to my musical journey, featuring works from my band "Beatsilog" and solo compositions
          under the name "Myst_iU". This serves as a testament to my growth and experience as a musician and recording
          artist over the past five years.</p>

            <h3>Beatsilog</h3>
            <p class="description">The band's biggest and (most expensive) production. Personally, this is one of those
              songs that I wish I could've repeated. While it was the band's most effortful work, it proved to be more
              difficult than we expected. The production rush, working with a production team, and the expectations
              being at an all-time high since this was our first song to be released under our previous record label,
              DITTO Philippines, taught me to appreciate the simplicity of songwriting. I now consider the entire
              experience a wake-up call to improve the other aspects of becoming a recording artist.</p>

            <p>Bawat Saglit</p>
            <h3>Beatsilog</h3>
            <p class="description">My most memorable composition, this song was first conceived in late 2019 when I was
              experiencing a depressing time in my life. Initially, it was a love song dedicated to a certain someone,
              but it quickly took a gloomy turn when things didn’t go as expected. Still, without that challenging time
              in my life, this song wouldn't have turned out the way it did.</p>

            <h3>Beatsilog</h3>
            <p class="description">Our band's most popular song! While I wasn't as involved in the production of this
              song, only contributing to the early composition process and adding extra instrumentals like synths (I
              don't even appear in the music video due to quarantine restrictions at the time), it remains one of my
              favorite songs to listen to. There's something about its catchy hook and addictive chorus that I've come
              to love.</p>

            <p>Selene</p>
            <h3>Beatsilog</h3>
            <p class="description">More of my newer compositions. At this point in time, I've developed and matured as
              an artist and have moved past the idea that complicated music equates to good music. For once, I felt a
              sense of artistic peace. The song's title, "Selene," was inspired by the naming conventions of formidable
              jazz artists who used feminine names for their songs or albums.</p>

            <h3>Beatsilog</h3>
            <p class="description">The band's first-ever music video! This was a very fun project to work on, and I
              consider it to be the discovery stage for most of the band, including myself. The composition was also a
              sequel to "Bawat Saglit." While the two songs are not connected canonically, the videos share similar
              themes of "romantic break-up," though this one leans more into the frustrations and anger that follow
              being wronged. This was also a time when the band was quite shy about our musical capabilities, and as a
              result, I took the lead in composing the song on my own. I'm glad that it's not the case anymore.</p>

            <h3>Myst_iU</h3>
            <p class="description">One of my favorites from my very early works, this song wasn't so much a test of my
              songwriting capabilities as it was a test of my production skills. Let's just say I still had quite a bit
              to learn. I could go on all day about how much I dislike certain aspects of it, such as the instruments I
              used, the production, and the samples, but I learned that we all start somewhere. My critical view of my
              old work is one of the strongest signs that I've grown as a musician.</p>
